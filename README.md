# ThreeScript
TS ThreeScript is a shortcut language for 3D scenes creation.

The scenes created with the language can be exported and included into your site.

TS was launched in 2015 By Roberto Pl√°cido Teixeira and Ivan Moura Miranda.

ThreeScript is the language script using function returning Three.js instantiated classes.

for example, 'scene':
```
function scene() {
  return THREE.Scene();
}
```
The main functions are:

- scene();
- pcam(fov, aspect, near, far);
- wrend(parameters);
- boxgeo(w, h, d, ): create a box with the width 'w', height 'h', depth 'd', width segments 'ws', height segments 'hs', depth segments 'ds';
- sphgeo(r, ws, hs, ps, pl, ts, tl): creates a sphere geometry with the radius 'r', width segments 'ws', height segments, phi start 'ps', phiLength 'pl', thetaStart 'ts', thetaLength 'tl';
